    "# Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "You know at this point that machine learning on text requires that you first represent the text numerically. So far, you've done this with bag of words representations. But you can usually do better with word embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Word embeddings** (also called word vectors) represent each word numerically in such a way that the vector corresponds to how that word is used or what it means. Vector encodings are learned by considering the context in which the words appear. Words that appear in similar contexts will have similar vectors. For example, vectors for \"leopard\", \"lion\", and \"tiger\" will be close together, while they'll be far away from \"planet\" and \"castle\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Even cooler, relations between words can be examined with mathematical operations. Subtracting the vectors for \"man\" and \"woman\" will return another vector. If you add that to the vector for \"king\" the result is close to the vector for \"queen.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "![Word vector examples](https://www.tensorflow.org/images/linear-relationships.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "These vectors can be used as features for machine learning models. Word vectors will typically improve the performance of your models above bag of words encoding. spaCy provides embeddings learned from a model called Word2Vec. You can access them by loading a large language model like `en_core_web_lg`. Then they will be available on tokens from the `.vector` attribute."
